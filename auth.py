"""Optional shared-password authentication.

The IP allowlist in ``middleware`` is a network filter, not authentication:
anyone who can reach the port from an allowed address has full control. That
is fine on a LAN and useless the moment the server is reachable over a VPN or
a tunnel where every peer shares one source address.

This adds a second, opt-in layer *behind* the allowlist -- not instead of it.
Leave ``auth_password`` empty and nothing here does anything, which is the
default and the previous behaviour exactly.

The session is a signed cookie rather than server-side state, so it survives a
restart and costs no memory. It carries an expiry and an HMAC over that
expiry; there is nothing else to carry, because there is only one account.
